# chatRoom

The Chatroom is a web application that enables people to talk online. Since the Chatroom is written in Node.js, the installation of Node.js is required for it to run.

The download of Node.js is available on [this website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

The installation of Node.js could also be done by using Homebrew in macOS.

If Homebrew is not installed, open the Terminal app and enter the following command
```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" ```

Once Homebrew is installed, type the following command to install Node.js
```brew install node```

Running this app is easy. Open the Terminal app and go to the directory of the chatRoom, and type ```node loader.js``` to set up the database. Type in ```node server.js``` consequently and the app should be ready to go on [the port 8080](http://localhost:8080).
